You don't need to be a programmer to use a command-driven computer system, but
you should be comfortable using a keyboard to type letters, numbers, and some
special symbols.

## X200 Laptop

A customized Lenovo X200 laptop will be used for this course. Your
instructor/mentor/tutor should supply you with a laptop that is all set to use.
The [beginners guide][bg] should help you out when you are on your own.

> System install and configuration will not be covered but the process is
> relatively straightforward. See [mini1404 setup][1404] and

#### The X200 Keyboard

![x200-keyboard](keyboard.jpg)

For keys that have blue symbols, you need to press the blue `Fn` key (lower left
area of the keyboard) at the same time to trigger that key's action. Examples

- `Fn` + `F12` to quickly "hibernate"
- `Fn` + `Home` to increase display brightness
